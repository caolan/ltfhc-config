# Poll		This file contains a list of the systems which are to be
#		polled, and the hours during which they are to be polled.
#		Normally, uudemon.hr processes this file hourly.
#
# Version:	@(#)Poll	2.10	19-Dec-1996
#
# Example:
schedule        kalemie 19
poll    kalemie 19 20 21 22 23 00 01 02 03 04 05
#
#		Note that every system needs 1 line for schedule AND
#		1 line for poll. The schedule action only touches an empty
#		file so that UUCP knows there is work to do for the remote
#		system. The "poll" is then only done if that file is present.
#		This is a crude dialing retry system.
